## Objectives: 
- Detect and analyse traffic anomalies
- Monitor endpoints for threats
- Utilise SIEM tools to handle incidents
- Investigate forensic artefacts

## My Experience:
As an aspiring SOC analyst, I was thrilled to complete TryHackMe's specialized training for the role. The course provided a comprehensive overview of numerous industry tools and frameworks, which was both exciting and enlightening. I enjoyed getting hands-on experience with familiar tools like SIEMs, Wireshark, and Snort, which are staples in the industry.

However, what truly enriched my learning experience was the exposure to new and advanced tools that I had never encountered before, such as Autopsy, Zeek, and OSquery. These tools opened up new perspectives on how to approach and handle different aspects of cybersecurity. For instance, using Autopsy for digital forensics, Zeek for network monitoring, and OSquery for endpoint security provided me with a deeper understanding of the multifaceted nature of SOC operations. This training has not only broadened my skill set but also reinforced my passion for pursuing a career in cybersecurity, particularly in SOC analysis.
